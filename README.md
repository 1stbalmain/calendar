# Calendar

## Scouts | Terrain -> JANDI incoming webhook integration

### Currently under redevelopment.

---

Calendar is a small Python script you can run as a daily cronjob. Given a login to Scouts | Terrain, it will find any events for the current day in a specified section that the account has access to, and post details on two JANDI topics.

See all features below.

| `timezone`           | `Australia/Sydney`           | Your timezone (corrects for daylight saving)                                                                                                                              |

## Features

Sends a message (see sample output below) to the youth members' JANDI topic with full event details. 

Sends a message to any parents' topic with concise details.

Makes any what3words addresses clickable and highlights where they are in normal terms. Also highlights when they may be incorrect (i.e. outside Australia)

Only notifies of events starting on the current day in the specified timezone. Due to the way Terrain stores and retrieves events in UTC, there are known issues with this.

There are more, documentation is coming soon...
